The ASK Centre, the first community social centre in Canada run by a homophile organization, opened at the end of 1966. The idea for a social group called The Circle did not disappear, however. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, a non-profit homophile organization called The Circle was active in Vancouver under the direction of Mrs. D. Beck. It was devoted to education and personal counselling on homosexuality. (see also December 31, 1966.)"

Chief Justice John R. Cartwright, who had recommended quashing Klippert's preventive detention sentence, in a dissenting opinion suggested that the laws regarding homosexuality be clarified, and that it was not their intention to incarcarate harmless homosexuals for life. Intense media and political interest followed the dismissal of Klippert's appeal and influenced Justice Minister Pierre Trudeau in introducing amendments to the Criminal Code concerning homosexuality (Bill C-150). Although these amendments would eventually come into effect in August 1969, Klippert was not paroled until July 20,1971. (See also August 1965; March 9, 1966 November 8, and December 21,1967.)"

During the late 1970s and early 1980s General Idea garnered an international art following, and in 1984 held the Miss General Idea Pavilion retrospective at the Art Gallery of Ontario. During the late 1980s their art focussed more on the AIDS crisis — their AIDS logo spoofing the famous LOVE sign created by Robert Indiana became internationally famous.

Justice Minister John Turner declared that Bill C-150 was not intended to condone, endorse, or encourage homosexuality and that it doesn't even legalize this kind of conduct but instead lifted the taint or stigma of the law from certain sexual acts committed by two consenting adults in private. Such behaviour. Turner concluded, was cause for psychiatric rather than legal intervention. During the debate numerous complaints were raised about the amendments concerning homosexuality, particularly from members of the Progressive Conservative and Créditiste parties. For example, Eldon Woolliams (pc -Calgary North) stated, ... I do not want to have this kind of debauchery in our nation, while Walter Dinsdale ( pc -Brandon-Souris) declared, We are bringing the morals and values of skid row into the salons and drawing rooms of the nation. Martial Asselin ( pc -Charlevoix) believed that Homosexuals are mostly inclined to pervert youngsters and the Minister opens the door even wider. The fourteen Créditiste MPS, led by Réal Caouette and all from Quebec, were the most critical of the changes introduced by the Bill — especially those relating to homosexuality and abortion — and suggested that communism, socialism, and atheism were behind the changes. André Fortin (Créd.-Lotbinière) declared that the amendments dealing with homosexuality should be withdrawn pure and simple while René Matte (Créd.-Champlain) said it was almost scandalous to see representatives of the people being obliged to discuss these questions. The Créditistes demanded that a public referendum be held on these issues and staged a filibuster of Parliament over the amendments concerning abortion. (see also May 14 and August 26,1969.)"

In the article, Bédard claimed that ISEA had 4,000 members and that it was affiliated with NACHO; both claims were unlikely. The censorship of the article was raised on March 3, 1970, before the Senate committee on mass media."

He had been an undergraduate at Cornell University when in the spring of 1967 he had helped to form the Cornell Student Homophile League, the second homophile group organized at an American University. Moldenhauer's advertisement in the Varsity was the spark for the first formal meeting on October 24, 1969, of the University of Toronto Homophile Association (UTHA), the first post-Stonewall gay organization in Canada and the first formed at a Canadian University. Over the next few years, Moldenhauer would be instrumental in founding several other pioneering Canadian gay organizations, including The Body Politic, Glad Day Bookshop, Toronto Gay Action, and the Canadian Gay Liberation Movement Archives .

Young had been involved with Catalyst, a literary magazine produced by graduate English students at the University of Toronto, since early 1969. In the fall of that year, he gained control of the magazine (with Michael Higgins and John Holland). In the wake of Stonewall, Young felt the time was right to transform Catalyst into a small press specializing in books and chapbooks of gay poetry and fiction. Young started the press with no money and virtually no publishing experience. Catalyst's first book publication was Cool Fire: 10 Poems by Ian Young and Richard Phelan (1970). Young was able to publish over thirty titles by Canadian, British, and American writers before the press suspended publication in 1980."

Also, the Ephemerals, a revolutionary drag group similar to The Cockettes, were associated with the GLF. Formed by Twilight Rose (pseud, of John Forbes) and Ruby Tuesday (pseud, of Ron Whinton), the Ephemerals specialized in street theatre that satirized drag and mocked traditional male-female roles and stereotypes. The GLF was short-lived, disbanding by the autumn of 1971. Its demise was partly due to the secession of Dick Rulens and others from the group to form the Canadian Gay Activists Alliance (CGAA) in February 1971.

Also, the Ephemerals, a revolutionary drag group similar to The Cockettes, were associated with the GLF. Formed by Twilight Rose (pseud, of John Forbes) and Ruby Tuesday (pseud, of Ron Whinton), the Ephemerals specialized in street theatre that satirized drag and mocked traditional male-female roles and stereotypes. The GLF was short-lived, disbanding by the autumn of 1971. Its demise was partly due to the secession of Dick Rulens and others from the group to form the Canadian Gay Activists Alliance (CGAA) in February 1971. Many of the remaining members of GLF joined the Gay Alliance toward Equality (GATE), formed in May 1971. (see also February, May, and June 27, 1971.)"

The UGHA believed that morally, socially, physically, psychologically, emotionally, and in every other way the homosexual is not inferior to the heterosexual, and homosexuality is in no way inferior to heterosexuality as a valid way of life. Paul Maurice, editor of the student newspaper the Ontarion, became the group's first chairperson, UGHA had problems organizing in its early days and collapsed in late 1971, but was revived in September 1973 with Heather Ramsay and Rick Stenhouse as prominent members. The revived UGHA sponsored a speaker's bureau, dances, and a newsletter. The group received much publicity in the Ontarion; the paper ran a regular Gays at Guelph column starting in autumn 1973. Late in 1975 UGHA was renamed Guelph Gay Equality."

In its first five months the FLH grew from thirty to 200 members, attracting a wide diversity of men and women with differing goals and ideologies. In November 1971, the more progressive members (including the founders) left when the membership decided to legally incorporate the FLH, and the group became more service- oriented and social. By October the FLH was operating a drop-in centre at 2065, rue St. Denis, which was active until May 1972 when it was closed by order of the City. In June 1972 the centre was reopened at 279, rue Ste. Catherine E. The grand reopening of the centre was raided by the police on June 17-18,1972. As a result, many FLH members were scared away and the group's executive resigned. By the autumn of 1972 the FLH had collapsed. (see also, June 17-18, 1972.)"

The group's early activities included lobbying the Alberta government to amend the Alberta Bill of Rights and the Individual's Rights Protection Act to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation and asking candidates about gay rights during the 1972 federal and provincial election campaigns. In mid-1973 Roberts was succeeded as regional coordinator by Don Musbach, and the group began to focus more on social services as opposed to political activity.

The group had emerged out of popular gay-consciousness discussions offered by instructors Bruce Garside, Linda Page-Hollander, and John Southin in the course Biology and Social Change, dating back to the 1971-72 school year. James Young became the first president of GAY, and Patrick Ormos acted as liaison officer. The movement by gay students to organize at McGill was opposed from the start, particularly by a group known as the Society for the Repression of Homosexuality (SRH ). The SRH'S flyers, distributed on campus, described homosexuality as a repugnant mental illness; the group's aim was to oppose (by peaceful means) the passive acceptance of homosexuality by today's lax society and to encourage psychiatric treatment as a viable alternative for homosexuals. GAY was originally devoted to study groups, consciousness raising, and discussion, and soon attracted anglophone members from outside the University. Community services became a focus, with the establishment of a gayline information service (active until November 1973), a women's committee, a speaker's bureau, a newsletter, drop-in nights, and community dances (to summer 1973). Many of these community services and activities were taken over by the Centre d'accueil homophile/Gay Community Centre and by the AHM/GMA after their formation in June 1973. Gay McGill's activities were focussed around the school year, but for most of 1975 it was not active at all. In the autumn of 1975 Gay McGill attempted to revive the McGill dances but was ultimately unsuccessful. (see also June 27, 1973)"

Later, stimulated by this visit, Dr. John Stewart and Susan Rosenthal decided to form a gay liberation organization at McMaster University.

Gay McGill sponsored the dances until the summer of 1973, after which time they were sponsored by AHM/GMA (although still held at McGill). By 1973-74 the McGill dances had become so popular that they may have been the largest regularly held gay dances in the world, attracting up to two thousand people each. Although very successful, the dances were discontinued in April 1975 after the Québec liquor permit board withdrew the group's liquor licence. Gay McGill attempted to revive the dances in the autumn of 1975 but was ultimately unsuccessful."

As one who believes that personal matters of this nature are one's own business, and should not be flaunted publicly, I cannot accept that a wide problem exists in this regard.

The AHM/ GMA was organized out of the Centre d'accueil homophile/Gay Community Centre, which had wanted to expand into the social, service, and political spheres, and to involve more people. About ninety percent of the group's charter members attended, many of whom were women. Robert Valise was elected president; the other officers were Danielle Dahan (vice-president), Tony Farebrother (secretary), and Felicity Stevens (treasurer). The AHM/GMA was anxious from the start to balance francophone/anglophone and male/ female elements in the organization but was ultimately unsuccessful — eventually most members were male anglophones. It sponsored a variety of activities: the large drop-in centre located at 3439, rue St. Denis, counselling services, a gayline, a coffee house, a newsletter (Gay-Zette), a civil liberties committee, and the McGill dances. Financial problems fueled by the cancellation of the McGill dances, and internal divisions, led to a series of collapses. The demise of AHM/GMA occurred by February 1976, although a few members were able to continue to operate the gay information phone line Gay Info. (see also May 6,1974, and July 1975 .)"

This was a manifestation of frustrations that had been growing within the group. Some members raised questions of financial irregularities related to the proceeds from the monthly McGill dances, sponsored by the AHM/GMA. Others questioned the perceived inertia and timidity of the group's leadership. More explosive still were accusations by francophone members that their concerns were being ignored in the officially bilingual, but predominantly anglophone, organization. These problems led to a split in the AHM/GMA and the formation of the francophone-dominated Front homosexuel Québécois de liberation (FHQL) by March 18, 1974. (see also March 18,1974.)"

It was then that he uncovered an attempt to replace him as chairperson for the rest of his term (to August 31,1975) because the department had lost confidence in him. Eliot-Hurst suspected the real reason behind his medical suspension was the University administration's disapproval of his open homosexuality and Marxist politics. After much wrangling, Eliot-Hurst was reinstated as chairperson of the Department of Geography effective August 15,1975, only two weeks before his term was to expire."

On February 14 GATE (Toronto) began to campaign for Damien's reinstatement, as well as for the formation of a commission of enquiry into his firing and into the status of gay people working in positions under Ontario government jurisdiction. The Committee to Defend John Damien was established February 22, with Christine Bearchell as chairperson. The Damien case was to become one of the most prominent gay civil rights cases in Canadian history. After much legal wrangling the case remained partially unresolved when Damien died in Windsor of pancreatic cancer on December 24,1986. His suit for wrongful dismissal against the Ontario Racing Commission was settled in 1986; Damien received a year's wages plus interest, about $50,000. A second suit, for loss of income, had been placed against the estate of Thoreau Willard O'Mulvenny, a Fort Erie racetrack doctor who had informed the Ontario Jockey Club in 1974 that Damien was a homosexual. The case had not yet been heard when Damien died.

The case involved GATE (Vancouver)'s complaint against the Vancouver Sun that the paper's refusal to print a two-line classified ad for Gay Tide contravened the British Columbia Human Rights Act. During the hearing, testimony was given concerning Sun publisher Stuart Keate's notion that homosexuality was a threat to society and that it was linked to problems regarding V.D. and crime. On January 12, 1976, the Board of Inquiry, chaired by Vancouver lawyer Joe Wood, ruled that the Vancouver Sun had violated the provincial Human Rights Code; it ordered the Sun to pay GATE $500 in costs and to refrain from committing the same or similar contraventions of the Code in future. GATE organized a victory picket of about fifty people outside of the Sun's Pacific Press Building. On July 16, 1976, the Sun appealed the ruling to the B.C. Supreme Court, but in August the court rejected the appeal and upheld the Board's ruling. On June 10,1977, the ruling was overturned by the B.C.

On May 22,1979, in a six to three decision, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal of GATE (Vancouver), ruling that freedom of the press allowed the Sun reasonable cause to refuse the ad.

Justice Minister Jérôme Choquette and Liberal members of the National Assembly's parliamentary Justice Committee, supported by the Créditistes, defeated a PQ amendment to Bill 50, the province's proposed Charter of Rights, that would have outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation. Opposition members, particularly Robert Burns (PQ -Maisonneuve) and Jacques-Yvan Morin (PQ -Sauve), protested the move, declaring that an impressive number of religious, social, legal, and union organizations had supported the demands of the gay coalition fighting for the amendment. Choquette, however, stated that Quebec society was not yet ready for such legal sanctions for homosexuals. The Charter was adopted July 7,1975, without legal protection on the basis of sexual orientation, and came into effect June 28, 1976. The Charter was eventually amended to include sexual orientation on December 15, 1977, under a PQ government, when only two of the 110 members of the Assembly voted against the amendment. At that time Quebec became the first Canadian province and the largest political jurisdiction in North America to provide legal protection for homosexuals."

The event was the largest and most geographically representative meeting of lesbians and gays in Canada to that time. About 200 people took part in the conference, which included caucuses, workshops, street theatre, dances, and a demonstration on Parliament Hill (June 30). The 150 registered delegates, of whom only about twenty were women, represented almost every city in Canada, and many points of view. Growing divisions in the gay movement were evident, and at least five distinctive subgroupings were present: religious, service-oriented, rights-oriented, anarchist, and leftist. The groups were able to compromise, however, to reach a consensus on a ten-point programme for the NGRC/CNDH, which included the controversial recommendation to abolish all age-of-consent laws. The conference also voted to support other resolutions: to urge all gay organizations to take up the defence of John Damien; to send a message of support to Dr. Henry Morgentaler, commending his contributions to the struggle for women's rights, and calling for his release from prison; to support the struggle of gays in Quebec; and to stage simultaneous demonstrations across Canada in the autumn of 1975 to protest anti-homosexual provisions in the federal Immigration Act. The issue of lesbian participation arose in a resolution, later adopted, which gave the Women's Caucus delegate status and established a person to act as a liaison to encourage lesbian participation in the NGRC/ CNDH. As well, this was the first Canadian national conference in which delegates from Quebec played a significant role; six groups from Montreal sent delegates, as did one group from Quebec City, The NGRC/CNDH originally consisted of twenty-seven member groups and was to be coordinated by GO. Ron Dayman was named the first secretary of the group's national coordinating office. The NGRC/CNDH was renamed the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Rights Coalition/Coalition canadienne pour les droits des lesbiennes et gais (CLGRC/CCDLG) in 1978 and was active until June 1980."

The Project provided a variety of services to the anglophone gay community, including a gayline, individual and group counselling, community relations groups, a foster children's project, a gay youth group, and educational seminars. It was coordinated by Miriam Boghen and employed two gay social workers (Bruce Garside and Joanne Stitt) as well as about forty male and female volunteers recruited from the gay community. Although it was meant to serve all members of the community, there were some complaints early on that the Project was male-oriented and did not serve lesbians well."

At that time, Wilson was the first vice-president of the Gay Community Centre of Saskatoon and had been trying to start a gay academic union at the University. Although he was qualified to do the job, Wilson was disqualified solely on the basis of his sexual orientation. Wilson protested, but the decision was upheld by University of Saskatchewan president R.W. Begg. Members of the Department of Educational Foundations immediately protested the decision and a Committee to Defend Doug Wilson was established. The Wilson case generated much support from groups and organizations in Saskatchewan (and elsewhere) and considerable coverage in the media.

Johnson ruled that the word sex in the Human Rights Act referred to gender only and that the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission did not have the jurisdiction to proceed with a hearing. Wilson vowed to appeal the decision, while the Committee to Defend Doug Wilson continued to raise funds for legal costs.

This decision related to the Wilson job-discrimination case against the University of Saskatchewan, and overturned the ruling by the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission of November 9, 1975. Wilson vowed to appeal the court injunction, while the Committee to Defend Doug Wilson continued to raise funds for legal costs. The Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission, however, did not appeal the ruling, and Wilson, along with the Committee to Defend Doug Wilson, decided by March 1976 to abandon pursuing the case any further due to high legal costs and a low chance of success. The Committee to Defend Doug Wilson was dissolved by the end of 1976. (See also March 22, 1976, and April 21, 1976.)"

Seventeen other men were also arrested and charged with contributing to juvenile delinquency, gross indecency, or buggery. None of the youths were charged.

On March 18, 1975, one of the arrested men, Warren Zufelt, committed suicide by jumping from an apartment building. The case only grew in sensation. Michel Gravel eventually pleaded guilty to charges of operating a common bawdy house and gross indecency, and in September 1975 was sentenced to two years less a day at the Guelph Correctional Centre. The remaining defendants were dragged through the courts, and although some were found guilty of engaging in sexual activities with juvenile males, none of them received a jail term or a fine; the charges were dismissed or the men were given absolute discharges or suspended sentences.

The conference reconvened, without the men, with the discussion focusing on lesbian autonomy. At the end of the conference, the lesbians met with the men to report on their discussion. They reported a need for an autonomous lesbian movement in Canada and the establishment of an informal coalition to work towards this goal. (See also June 1976 .)"

Additional misleading articles and editorials about the course were published by the Star in the following weeks.

Two other similar murders had occurred in Toronto in the previous two years; each victim was found naked in his bedroom, dead from a combination of stabbing, strangulation, and beating. Each victim was gay and had visited a gay bar the night before his murder. The similarity of the deaths led police to believe that one person may have been responsible for the murders, which have never been solved. Sergeant Julian Fantino was one of the officers who investigated the Latocki case; he later became Toronto's chief of police, commissioner of the OPP, an MP, and a federal cabinet minister."

Gay groups including GATE (Toronto), CHAT, and GO protested to Armstrong, calling for him to either apologize for the slur or resign from the commission. On June 2, 1977, the newspaper's editorial director, Errol Townshend, published an editorial that attacked gays and supporters of gay rights. Then, on June 9, the newspaper published a letter from Brian Mossop, the president of GATE (Toronto), demanding that Townshend apologize to the paper's gay readers. Mossop was in turn attacked in print with Townshend's reply: We're so sorry we hurt your feelings, darling. But we're not going to kiss and make up tonight. We're not in the mood (smile). You know what we mean. Now, drop dead. But get one thing straight before you do: Blacks and your crowd are not in the same boat. Meanwhile, Armstrong said that while he would not allow derogatory epithets in the paper, As a newspaper publisher I did not, and I will not, limit free expression of opinion in the pages of The Islander...

This was a major battle and was seen as the first defeat in the struggle for gay civil rights in the United States. Save Our Children's tactics included an early, successful use of the fear of child molestation, which would be used by anti-gay forces during the remainder of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s.

The conference featured a march (on July 1) of 250 people for lesbian and gay rights, through downtown Saskatoon, as well as workshops and cultural and social programming including an art exhibition, book displays, film screenings, and a cabaret and dances. There were five workshops specifically for lesbians, which drew a large number of women. Delegates also approved ensuring that lesbians had 50 percent voting control during resolutions. Resolutions adopted at the conference included plans for a National Day of Protest to be held in October 1977 and that would use the John Damien case as a focus for the human rights/sexual orientation issue. A national petition on human rights was to be circulated by the NGRC, and detailed plans for strategy during the next federal election were discussed. The NGRC also agreed that it would intervene at CRTC hearings when CBC licence-renewal applications were heard. In addition, the NGRC voted to oppose the airing of any commercial message that featured Anita Bryant or any representative of Save Our Children , and opposed Bryant's entry into Canada."

(At the time of sentencing, Schisler was the president of Gays at Ryerson[GAR].) Members of GATE picketed the courthouse to protest police harassment. Foreman and Schisler appealed their conviction, and on May 10, 1978, County Court Judge Roger Conant refused to drop the charges but did reduce their sentences to a fine of $100 each. Foreman and Schisler appealed their conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which on March 9, 1979, refused permission to appeal the conviction."

He had been assaulted and drowned in a sink on July 28. Four men were later charged with first-degree murder: Saul David Betesh, Werner Gruener, Robert Wayne Kribs, and Josef Woods. This case launched a public outcry that became focused on the Yonge Street sex strip. The gay community was also drawn into the case because Saul Betesh had contacted George Hislop, president of CHAT, after the murder to ask for advice; Hislop told him to turn himself in to police. The Jaques case generated intense news coverage in the press, on radio, and on television. At least one commentator, Borden Spears, a senior editor at the Toronto Star, dared to claim that some of the media coverage was tasteless, unprofessional, and prejudicial to the case.

The Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC ), which represented most of Canada's civil servants, later presented a brief to the federal government criticizing its approach to homosexuality and security clearances: There is no evidence that homosexuals, any more than heterosexuals, are likely to reveal state secrets as a result of seduction or blackmail."

Don Tapscott, representing the Revolutionary Workers' League (RWL), consistently defended the rights of gay people throughout the campaign. Another candidate, Eddie Keehn, was a militant Christian who called for the closure of gay clubs and the firing of gay and lesbian city employees.

The arrested men included two lawyers, fifteen teachers, and a school director. The owner of Truxx, Giuseppe Salvaggio, was charged with keeping a common bawdy house. Eight charges of gross indecency and two of possession of illegal drugs were also laid. All of the men charged were taken to police headquarters and held for fifteen hours without bail, and were subjected to compulsory VD testing. All but one of the men pleaded not guilty to the charges. Charges against most of the found-ins were dropped, but only after five years. On December 14, 1982, the charges against 120 men were dismissed after the Crown Attorney advised the judge that he would not be proceeding with the case as it would cost too much money. This was the largest mass arrest in Canada since the War Measures Act was invoked during the FLQ crisis in October 1970. It came only one week after Montréal had hosted the First National Congress of Gay Men and Lesbians in Québec. Truxx reopened, was renovated, and attracted larger crowds than ever (including women), but the bar closed for good on March 19, 1978. Truxx, a twenty-one-minute film by Keith Lemmon Sutherland Communications Corporation, documented the raid and was shown in the official programme of the Toronto Festival of Festivals in 1978.

The charge arose out of the police raid on the Club Baths of Ottawa on May 22, 1976, during which acts of oral sex had been observed by officers. Maloney had been a shareholder and secretary-treasurer of the club, and was arrested later in Toronto. Ryan concluded that although gay sauna clubs may have a place in the community, the sexual acts that occur there must be private, and cannot take place in front of observers. Maloney received a conditional discharge, with the provision he sever links with the club and report to a probation officer for a year."

The medal was to be presented during Bryant's upcoming visit to North York, on January 15, 1978, which was coordinated by Rev. Ken Campbell of the Campbell-Reese Evangelical Association and Renaissance International. Lastman later backtracked, and on January 9, 1978, withdrew the offer, stating that he had not realized the full extent of her campaign and could not agree that homosexuals should face discrimination in employment and accommodation."

To date, this was the largest gay rights demonstration in Toronto's history. The coalition that formed to protest Bryant and her Save Our Children campaign was the most broadly based, politically diverse collection of lesbian, gay, and feminist groups seen in Toronto to that time. This coalition sparked the interest of the RCMP, which conducted undercover surveillance of the anti-Bryant protests in Toronto. The rally itself was hosted by Pat Murphy of WAVAW. Twelve speakers representing a wide range of community groups addressed the rally; there were also three women singers and three skits. A march up Yonge Street followed, which was the largest and loudest gay demonstration in Toronto's history to that time. On January 15, Anita Bryant spoke at the People's Church in North York, while five hundred anti-Bryant demonstrators protested across the street. At the end of the service, Rev. Paul Smith of the People's Church was hit with a lavender cream pie, thrown by a protester. This was the first stop on Bryant's Christian Liberation Crusade, sponsored by Rev. Ken Campbell and the fundamentalist Christian group Renaissance International. Campbell announced plans for further Bryant rallies in major Canadian cities, to be held over the next six months. At the same time as Bryant's appearance at the People's Church, an inter-denominational service in support of gay rights was held at MCC Toronto, organized by Rev. Brent Hawkes.

The men appeared in court on February 28, 1978. Afterwards, their names and addresses were published in local media such as the Halifax Chronicle-Herald, local radio news broadcasts, on the Canadian Press wire service, and were featured on the CTV and CBC-TV national news. Wendell MacKay, deputy justice minister of Prince Edward Island, was one of the accused. After being charged, MacKay suffered self-inflicted gunshot wounds and spent time in hospital; he was later acquitted. GAE protested the charges, and the resulting media circus."

OPP constable Paul Head, twenty-eight, was arrested outside the Windsor Hotel (31 John St. North), a gay gathering place, and was taken to Burlington, Ontario, where he was charged with gross indecency and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile (for having sexual relations with a thirteen-year-old boy). OPP intelligence branch officers had been investigating Head's personal life after he had been spotted hanging out at gay bars. Head was immediately suspended from the OPP, and within hours had typed up a letter of resignation. Two days after submitting the letter of resignation Head withdrew it, saying that he had been forced into making it. The OPP said that the resignation had already been accepted and could not be withdrawn, and Head decided to go to court to fight for his reinstatement. Head was held in jail for two weeks before bail was posted. The charge of gross indecency against Head was eventually dropped, but he did plead guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile, a lesser charge, and was given a suspended sentence and one year's probation. The case for Head's reinstatement to the OPP, however, dragged on for years, all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada.

        "event": "December 9–22 Toronto On December 9, 1978, policemen raided the Barracks baths (56 Widmer Street) and arrested twenty-eight men. Twenty-three of the men were charged with being found-ins in a common bawdy house, and five with keeping a common bawdy house. George Hislop, president of CHAT, was one of the men charged as a keeper. About twenty policemen participated in the raid, and used hammers and crowbars to smash in doors and open lockers. Police also seized the 800-name membership list for the Barracks, as well as membership cards. This is believed to be the first organized assault by police on a gay bathhouse in Toronto's history. On December 11, about 400 people attended a community meeting held at the 519 Church Street Community Centre to discuss options for an organized action against the police raid. A press conference was held December 12, and on December 16, 400 people marched from the 519 Church Street Community Centre to Toronto City Hall for a rally, which was addressed by Alderman Dan Heap, Tim McCaskell of the Body Politic, Rev. Brent Hawkes of MCC, and others. On December 12, the accused men appeared in provincial court before Judge Jack Climans, pleaded not guilty, and were remanded. On December 22, the December 9th Defence Fund was formalized, with Michael Laking as chair and Rev. Brent Hawkes as treasurer. The fund hoped to raise up to $100,000 to help cover the legal expenses of the owners and found-ins.

By late January, however, the majority of the hundreds of letters and telephone calls received at the mayor's office supported his stand. (See also January 7, 1979, and March 6, 1979.)"

Currie had mused about the statistical probability of there being a gay cabinet minister in Saskatchewan. Collver demanded in the Legislature that Premier Allan Blakeney respond to the charge, noting that homosexuals were easily blackmailed. Blakeney called Collver's comments contemptible, denying the presence of any homosexuals in the cabinet. He also threatened to sue Collver for slander if he repeated the accusation outside of the Legislature. The controversy abated, and Collver stepped down as leader of the Progressive Conservatives on May 28, 1979. (See also April 20, 1979.)"

The report had recommended that human rights protection be extended to people with disabilities, to the elderly and young, and to gays and lesbians. The rally was addressed by leaders of both Ontario opposition parties (Stuart Smith of the Liberals and Michael Cassidy of the NDP), both of whom claimed that controversy over sexual orientation was delaying changes to the code. Ontario's labour minister Robert Elgie, the minister responsible for introducing human rights amendments, was booed by the crowd when he delivered a speech that avoided the issues and stated that change would not come quickly."

Jones and his lawyer demanded that the Saskatchewan Minister of Education constitute a Board of Reference under the Education Act to investigate the firing and rule on its legality. The SGCC established the Fight Back Defence Fund to help pay for legal costs, and also circulated a petition to protest the school board's actions.

The policeman had telephoned Franco to say that he was responding to an ad in the Body Politic. He was invited into Franco's home and discussed sexual acts with him. Franco was interested in sadomasochism, had a dungeon in his home, and advertised for partners regularly in the Body Politic. He had been one of the found-ins charged in the raid on the Barracks steam bath on December 9, 1978. When Sergeant Gary Donovan of the Police Intelligence Bureau later informed Franco's school board about the charges, Franco informed Rev. Brent Hawkes of MCC Toronto about what had happened and Hawkes made the matter public. Franco later became involved with the RTPC as membership secretary. The police raided Franco's home and confiscated various items, including membership lists of the RTPC and of the NDP Gay Caucus. The raid on Franco's home was widely condemned in the gay community, and was seen as an act of revenge on the part of the police. The case made legal history, as it was the first time in Canada that a private home had been charged as a bawdy house when there was neither prostitution nor sex with minors involved.

The theme of Celebration '79 was the celebration of ten years of gay liberation in Canada. Twenty-nine workshops were held, as well as three panel discussions, numerous social activities, and a march. The CLGRC/CCDLG decided to move toward the creation of a central databank of cases of discrimination based on sexual orientation. This decision was based on advice given by Gordon Fairweather, chief commissioner of the CHRC, who was a guest panellist at the conference. The conference itself received mixed reviews. There was friction between organizers interested in local, grassroots action, and those who supported a national strategy. Few lesbians attended the conference, and the matter of lesbian participation led to bitter debates. Evangelist Ken Campbell of Renaissance Canada was also in Ottawa this weekend. He criticized Mayor Dewar for welcoming fornicators into the city, and sponsored his own Festival of Faith, Freedom, and the Family. Bill Prankard of the Bill Prankard Evangelistic Association also attacked Mayor Dewar in the press for allowing Celebration '79 to be held in Ottawa."

As soon as the news hit the press, though, there was considerable public backlash against the proposed centre, including petitions and letters of complaint sent to the Moose Jaw City Council.

On November 9, Alberta labour minister Les Young, the minister responsible for the AHRC, was interviewed by the Edmonton Journal and stated that he was not disturbed by Lundrigan's views on gay rights and proceeded to make discriminatory, anti-gay remarks. Young remarked that Albertans who made their homosexuality obvious should be prepared to face discrimination. Local gay and lesbian activists were outraged; Young was characterized as Alberta's George Wallace without a wheelchair. Lundrigan later reversed his position, and supported the inclusion of sexual orientation in the Individual Rights Protection Act. (See also February 5, 1980.)"

Crown counsel Ian MacDonnell argued that Provincial Court Judge Sydney Harris had made fundamental errors in his ruling to acquit PTP, and that the defendants either be found guilty as charged or the case be sent back to Provincial Court for a second trial.

The two main themes of the meeting were building an anti-racist lesbian and gay movement and how to fight the Right and win. The weekend included plenary sessions, panel discussions, workshops, social events, and cultural activities. Ironically, feminist socialism was hardly discussed at the conference. The final session discussed plans to launch a national Lavender Left Network."

He stunned the audience of sixty-five, though, when he discussed how the intestinal problems of some gay people posed a risk of contamination to the food service industry, since there were so many gay people working in that field. Hudecki eventually won the election by more than 2,000 votes."

In 1977, Frye had pleaded guilty to committing an indecent act likely to make a male child a juvenile delinquent, and was granted a conditional discharge. Frye subsequently won re-election as reeve. His campaign to unseat the incumbent mayor, Don Lappan, was marked by the distribution of hate literature that claimed Frye would promote a gay lifestyle and would lead the town into moral decay. Lappan was returned to office by a vote of 1,954 to 1,164. One week after the election, Frye made an impassioned speech before the Tecumseh town council, declaring his homosexuality but also admitting that he was not proud to be gay and hoped to be cured. The negative tone of the remarks upset members of WGU, whose phone line was soon besieged by crank calls from teenagers asking for Cam Frye, or asking if there was a cure for homosexuality and how much it would cost."

        "event": "January Ottawa Justice Minister Jean Chrétien introduced Bill C–53, which was the Liberal government's response to the Law Reform Commission's 1978 Report on Sexual Offences. Bill C–53 proposed several revisions to the Criminal Code, including allowing for consensual group sex in private for people over the age of eighteen, and the introduction of special offences and penalties for people convicted of producing, distributing, or selling sexually explicit material depicting people who are or appear to be under sixteen years old. The proposed legislation also revised the age-of-consent laws by reducing the age of consent from twenty-one to eighteen years for homosexual acts, and introducing the concept of laddering to allow sexual activity for people less than sixteen years old with someone less than three years older. The government received hundreds of petitions and letters opposing the changes, and on June 15, 1982, Chrétien withdrew the amendments, including those decriminalizing buggery and sexual acts between more than two consenting adults. A watered-down Bill C–127 replaced Bill C–53, and passed in the House of Commons in August 1982. Many proposed reforms had been shelved, including those relating to child pornography. Buggery remained an offence, as did sex between more than two consenting adults at a time. The age of consent for homosexual acts remained at twenty-one."

The police charged 286 men either as found-ins (266) or keepers (20) of a common bawdy house in the largest mass arrest in Canada since the War Measures Act was imposed during the October Crisis of 1970. The men were humiliated and insulted. The city's health department required the alleged keepers to undergo compulsory VD checks. In addition, the police caused more than $35,000 in damage when they used crowbars and sledgehammers to break down doors, smash glass and mirrors, and destroy equipment. The Richmond Street Health Emporium was so badly damaged it closed permanently on February 17, 1981. In the weeks following the raids, there was also an increase in physical attacks on gay men within the gay village surrounding Yonge and Wellesley streets. There was much speculation concerning the reason behind the raids, and the timing of them. Although the police claimed that the raids came after six months of investigation, they coincidentally took place the same week that Ontario Premier Bill Davis called a provincial election for March 19, 1981. There was some speculation that the law-and-order Conservatives would use the raids to galvanize conservative voters to take back Toronto ridings held by the NDP. The bath raids were one of the most significant events in Toronto's gay history, and are sometimes referred to as Toronto's Stonewall. As of September 16, 1982, the cases of 261 men had been processed in the courts; 225 were found not guilty. Fifteen men pleaded guilty, and twenty pleaded not guilty but were found guilty (two of these were under appeal); the men found guilty received absolute or conditional discharges. The last remaining charge related to the February 5, 1981, raids was settled by plea bargain on February 7, 1985. The total cost of the raids to the taxpayers of Toronto and Ontario was estimated to be almost $10 million. In July 1982, a ninety-minute documentary that discusses the raids and reaction to them, premiered. Track Two, by Harry Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, and Gordon Keith, remains one of the most important documents of the entire affair; it was restored by PTP and re-released in 2011, to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the raids.

The 2,000-name membership list of the club was also seized. A total of forty Edmonton police officers, six members of the RCMP, and two Crown Attorneys participated in the raid, which was also videotaped by the police. The accused were questioned under an obscure section of the Criminal Code (Section 183) during a specially arranged 5 a.m. courtroom session; the arrested men later claimed that they were not allowed to contact lawyers during this questioning. On June 4, 1981, an article in the Edmonton Journal revealed that the entire police operation had been instigated by a complaint from a gay man (later identified as Fred Griffis) who, although he had never visited the Pisces, thought the activities that occurred there were immoral and should be stopped. This complaint resulted in a three-month investigation that included surveillance of the premises and the photographing of people entering and leaving the Pisces. Police Chief Robert Lunney admitted that the Edmonton force had consulted with Toronto police for advice on planning and conducting the raid. Local gay groups Dignity, GATE Edmonton, and MCC were active in protesting the raid from the beginning, by distributing leaflets, attending meetings and protests, and by providing counselling and support for the men charged. The local gay community also established a Gay Heritage Fund and (on June 1, 1981) a Privacy Defense Committee to help cover the legal fees of the men charged; more than $18,000 was raised in the first three days.

Rolf during a hastily arranged late-afternoon court session. This action was undertaken without consultation with the other men who were charged, and was done after several community meetings during which many of the found-ins indicated that they were willing to fight the charges in open court. Judge Rolf sentenced Dr. Toupin and John Kerr each to a fine of $10,000 or a year in jail. The Pisces Spa itself was fined $20,000, and co-owner Eric Stein received a fine of $5,000 or six months in jail. The found-ins were sentenced to fines of $250 each or thirty days in jail. Toupin's lawyer Robbie Davidson appealed the sentence to the Alberta Court of Appeal, arguing that the fine was excessive. Soon after the trial, the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons suspended the medical licence of Dr. Toupin, a neurologist, for six months for unbecoming conduct; after a review, this decision was upheld on September 11, 1981.

As they were leaving the peaceful protest of about 1,000 people, a large crowd of gay men and lesbians was attacked at Church and Charles streets by a group of anti-gay thugs wielding boards. When the crowd fought back, police rescued the gay bashers and then turned on the angry crowd with nightsticks. In the ensuing melee, involving dozens of people in the middle of Church Street, half a dozen people were injured and six people were arrested. The affair later became known as The Battle of Church Street. Rev. Brent Hawkes of MCC Toronto was held and punched by a police officer. Ken Popert of the Body Politic, a rally marshal, was struck by a police car. Both Hawkes and Popert failed in their attempt to press charges. (See also October 1, 1981.)"

The three men were stopped, but refused to cooperate with the policemen. Berg was thrown in jail for the evening, although no charges were laid. Harris later filed a complaint with the Calgary Police Commission. Harris's complaint against one policeman, Constable Boyle, was upheld after an internal police investigation concluded that Boyle had displayed unnecessary use of authority. Boyle was reprimanded, but complaints against three other officers were rejected."

Reporting activities were carried on even after the amendments to the Criminal Code in 1969 changed the legal status of homosexual activities. One of the report's 285 recommendations was that existing Security Service files on homosexuals be reviewed and that those which do not fall within the guidelines for opening and maintaining files be destroyed.

Diamond was determined to fight the police tactic of laying two charges, aimed at forcing defendants to plead guilty to one charge in return for having the other withdrawn. Diamond appeared in court January 25, 1982, charged with gross indecency. Defending himself, Diamond raised the issue of double jeopardy (prosecuting twice for one alleged offence).

The motion passed by a vote of seventeen to five. There was also to be a clear policy statement on non-discrimination in hiring and promotion. The second resolution, as modified and proposed by Alderman Gordon Chong, called for a gay awareness programme to be established and incorporated into a general Community Awareness Programme which would sensitize and maintain the sensitivity of members of the Metro Toronto Police Force and its recruits to the various minority groups which make up Metro Toronto. The motion passed twenty to two. The resolutions were opposed by Mayor Art Eggleton (who feared they suggested special status for the gay community), and Alderman Tony O'Donohue.

Campbell was fined $40,000, which he arranged to pay off in yearly instalments of $10,000, and left Toronto directly after his court appearance. His co-accused (Raymond Diemer, George Hislop, Jerry Levy, Peter Maloney, and Rick Stenhouse) were unaware of Campbell's plea bargain until they saw the report on the evening news.

The charges stemmed from the February 5 raids on the Barracks and Club Toronto bathhouses. Diemer had originally been charged on April 22, 1981, but was out of the country; he was released on his own recognizance and given a court date. On September 24, 1984, during a preliminary hearing for the conspiracy charges, the Crown decided not to proceed, offering the defendants plea bargaining opportunities. All charges against George Hislop and Peter Maloney were dropped in return for an agreement that they would not sue for malicious prosecution. The charges against the others were dropped in exchange for guilty pleas to one charge each. Raymond Diemer pleaded guilty to keeping a common bawdy house, the Barracks, and was fined $30,000. Jerry Levy pleaded guilty to keeping a common bawdy house, the Club Baths, and was fined $8,000. Rick Stenhouse pleaded guilty to possessing obscene material for distribution, and was fined $2,000."

On that date the Body Politic and three officers of PTP (Gerald Hannon, Ed Jackson, and Ken Popert) went to trial a second time to face charges of using the mails to transmit immoral and indecent material. On June 3, 1982, Provincial Court Judge Thomas Mercer acquitted the publication's three officers, ruling that the appearance of their names in the masthead did not prove their personal involvement, and on June 15, 1982, acquitted PTP of the charges. Mercer ruled that Men Loving Boys Loving Men does, in fact, advocate pedophilia but would be tolerated by the Canadian community. The Ontario Attorney General's ministry appealed the June 15 decision on July 13, 1982, asking that the court substitute a conviction on the charge of mailing indecent, immoral, or scurrilous material. On September 15, 1983, Ontario County Court Judge Patricia German heard the Crown's appeal of the June 15, 1982, acquittal. She ruled that Judge Mercer had not erred in the law in dismissing the charges, and upheld the acquittal. The Crown did not appeal the case, and as the Body Politic concluded in its November 1983 issue, After almost six years, two provincial court trials, three other separate court actions, six appeals, two trips to the Supreme Court of Canada, and more than $100,000 in legal bills, it was finally over."
